1. IDs and Classes help organize and target elements cleanly across HTML, CSS, and JS.
2. Data attributes store extra info in HTML elements and are accessed with .dataset in JS.
3. A DOM fragment is a lightweight container for batch-adding elements to the DOM efficiently.
4. A Virtual DOM speeds up UI updates by reducing direct DOM manipulation but uses more memory.
5. className is used instead of class in JS because class is a reserved keyword.
6. addEventListener allows multiple and flexible event handlers, unlike onClick, which allows only one.
